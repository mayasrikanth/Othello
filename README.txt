mprovements:

First we created a heuristic/ scoring system

Then for minimax:
we went two layers
we used the heuristic system


Tried a more basic heuristic where black - white
the assumption is that the number of coins per side doesn't matter until the end,
as the game could change to favor another side in one move
what's more important is the positions of thecoins
